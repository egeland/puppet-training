# Puppet training

This module provides a stack for launching Puppet training environments for
teaching people about Puppet.

It provides a stack that should be launched per-user that gives them a
functional Puppet Master, as well as a client server that can be used to apply
the Puppet modules onto.


# Stack Provisioning

For each member taking part in training, launch the environment using the
`stack.yaml` file.
